Today I Learned

This is a repository where we will add what we have learned today in a timely manner

Created to summarize in a mood as a TIL, as it is difficult to keep what we have learned from video learning and other materials

Note that all information inside is in Japanese. Please give me a break since I am Japanese.

See below for detailed information.
